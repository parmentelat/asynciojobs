    "The main and single purpose of this library is to allow for the static description of scenarii involving `asyncio`-compliant jobs, that have dependencies in the sense that a given job cannot start until its requirements have not completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a nutshell you would:\n",
    "\n",
    "* define a set of `Job` objects, \n",
    "* together with their `requires` relationship; that is to say, for each of them, which other jobs need to have completed before this one can be triggered,\n",
    "* and run this logic through an `Scheduler` object, that will orchestrate the whole scenario."

    "Further features allow to\n",
    "\n",
    "* define a job as *critical* or not; a critical job that raises an exception causes the orchestration to terminate abruptly;\n",
    "* define a job as running *forever*, in which case the scheduler of course won't wait for it, but instead will terminate it when all other jobs are done;\n",
    "* define a global `timeout` for the whole scheduler;\n",
    "* define a *window* in terms of a maximal number of simultaneous jobs that are allowed to run;\n",
    "* define *nested* schedulers: a `Scheduler` instance being also a job, a scheduler can be inserted in another scheduler just as if it were a re gular job; nested schedulers allow for reusability, since workflow pieces can be for example returned by regular python functions."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "A job object can be created:\n",
    "\n",
    "* either as a `Job` instance from a regular asyncio coroutine;\n",
    "* or by specializing the `AbstractJob` class, and defining its `co_run()` method; this is for example the case for the `SshJob` in the [`apssh` library](http://apssh.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a convenience, the `Sequence` class is a helper class that can free you from manually managing the `requires` deps in long strings of jobs that must run sequentially."

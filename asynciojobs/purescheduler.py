    """
    A PureScheduler instance is made of a set of AbstractJob objects.

    The purpose of the scheduler object is to orchestrate an execution of
    these jobs that respects the *required* relationships,
    until they are all complete. It starts with the ones that have no
    requirement, and then triggers the other ones as their requirement
    jobs complete.

    For this reason, the dependency/requirements graph **must be acyclic**.

    Optionnally a scheduler orchestration can be confined to a finite number
    of concurrent jobs (see the ``jobs_window`` parameter below).

    It is also possible to define a ``timeout`` attribute on the object,
    that will limit the execution time of a scheduler.


    Running an AbstractJob means executing its :meth:`co_run()` method,
    which must be a coroutine

    The result of a job's :meth:`~asynciojobs.job.AbstractJob.co_run()`
    is NOT taken into account, as
    long as it returns without raising an exception. If it does raise
    an exception, overall execution is aborted iff the job is
    critical. In all cases, the result and/or exception of each
    individual job can be inspected and retrieved individually at any
    time, including of course once the orchestration is complete.

    Parameters:
      jobs_or_sequences: instances of `AbstractJob` or `Sequence`.
        The order in which they are mentioned is irrelevant.
      jobs_window: is an integer that specifies how many jobs
        can be run simultaneously. None or 0 means no limit.
      timeout: can be an `int` or `float` and is expressed
       in seconds; it applies to the overall orchestration of that scheduler,
       not to any individual job. Can be also ``None``, which means no timeout.
      shutdown_timeout: same meaning as ``timeout``, but for the shutdown phase.
      watch: if the caller passes a :class:`~asynciojobs.watch.Watch`
        instance, it is used in debugging messages to show the time
        elapsed wrt that watch, instead of using the wall clock.
      verbose (bool): flag that says if execution should be verbose.


    Examples:
      Creating an empty scheduler::

        s = Scheduler()

      A scheduler with a single job::

        s = Scheduler(Job(asyncio.sleep(1)))

      A scheduler with 2 jobs in parallel::

        s = Scheduler(Job(asyncio.sleep(1)),
                      Job(asyncio.sleep(2)))

      A scheduler with 2 jobs in sequence::

        s = Scheduler(
                Sequence(
                    Job(asyncio.sleep(1)),
                    Job(asyncio.sleep(2))
                ))

    In this document, the ``Schedulable`` name refers to a type hint, that
    encompasses instances of either the `AbstractJob` or `Sequence` classes.

        Shut down the scheduler, by sending the
        :meth:`~asynciojobs.job.AbstractJob.co_shutdown()`
        method to all the jobs, possibly nested.

        Within nested schedulers, a job receives the `shutdown` event when its
        **enclosing** scheduler terminates, and **not** at the end of the
        **outermost** scheduler.

        Also note that all job instances receive the 'co_shutdown()' method,
        even the ones that have not yet started; it is up to the `co_shutdown()`
        method to triage the jobs according to their life cycle status - see
        :meth:`~asynciojobs.job.AbstractJob.is_running()` and similar.

        This mechanism should be used only for minimal housekeeping only, it is
        recommended that intrusive cleanup be made part of separate, explicit
        methods.

        :Note: typically in apssh for example, several jobs sharing the same ssh
        connection need to arrange for that connection to be kept alive across
        an entire scheduler lifespan, and closed later on. Historically there
        had been an attempt to deal with this automagically, through the present
        shutdown mechanism. However, this turned out to be the wrong choice, as
        the choice of closing connections needs to be left to the user.
        Additionally, with nested schedulers, this can become pretty awkward.
        Closing ssh connections is now to be achieved explicitly through a call
        to a specific apssh function.

        Returns:
          bool: True if all the

           methods attached to the jobs in the scheduler complete
           within ``shutdown_timeout``, which is an attribute of the scheduler.
           If the ``shutdown_timeout`` attribute on this object is ``None``,
           no timeout is implemented.

          There is probably space for a lot of improvement here xxx:

          - behaviour is unspecified if any of the co_shutdown()
            methods raises an exception;
          - right now, a subscheduler that sees a timeout expiration
            does not cause the overall co_shutdown() to return ``False``,
            which is arguable;
          - another possible weakness in current implementation is that
            it does not support to shutdown a scheduler that is still running.

        but it natively returns a graph instance. For that reason,
        its usage requires the installation of the ``graphviz`` package.

        This method is typically useful in a Jupyter notebook,
        so as to visualize a scheduler in graph format  - see
        http://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#jupyter-notebooks
        for how this works.

        The dependency from ``asynciojobs`` to ``graphviz`` is limited
        to this method and :meth:`export_as_pngfile()`,
        as it these are the only places that need it,
        and as installing ``graphviz`` can be cumbersome.

        For example, on MacOS I had to do both::

          brew install graphviz     # for the C/C++ binary stuff
          pip3 install graphviz     # for the python bindings
        """

        from graphviz import Source
        return Source(source=self.dot_format())


    def export_as_graphic(self, filename, suffix):
        """
        Convenience wrapper that creates a graphic output file.
        Like :meth:`graph()`,
        it requires the ``graphviz`` package to be installed.
        See also :meth:`export_as_pngfile()`, which is a shortcut to
        using this method with `suffix="png"`

        Parameters:
          filename: output filename, without the extension
          suffix: one of the suffixes supported by `dot -T`, e.g. `png` or `svg`

        Returns:
          created file name

        Notes:
          - This actually uses the binary `dot` program.
          - A file named as the output but with a ``.dot`` extension
            is created as an artefact by this method.
        """
        # we refrain from using graph.format / graph.render
        # because with that method we cannot control the location
        # of the .dot file; that is dangerous when using e.g.
        #    scheduler.export_as_pngfile(__file__)
        import os
        dotfile = f"{filename}.dot"
        self.export_as_dotfile(dotfile)
        pngfile = f"{filename}.{suffix}"
        os.system(f"dot -T{suffix} {dotfile} -o {pngfile}")
